Mailcow dashboard

# Introduction
Since long I use Mailcow as my mail services application. Based on docker it gives an ultimate flexibility in what I need.
Please look into https://mailcow.email if you want to learn more.

While setting up Mailcow, I at some point got interested in some statistics. I pondered to write my own scheme for it, but J6S already created an exporter for it: https://github.com/j6s/mailcow-exporter

Next on the list was something to graph the prometheus data with. I started playing around and finally created a dashboard, which you can find the source for in this repository.

Let us agree that you can download this as-is and as you wish, without guarantees, but that if you make improvements, I will be happy to hear them from you.

Thank you!
